# horiseon-code-refactor
## on-the-job ticket challenge
## Task: to take existing code and refactor it 

## Motivation:
* Helped me understand how to find patterns in CSS and change them into combined CSS descriptions

* distinguish between semantic tags and none semantic tags, e.g. DIV changed to SECTIONs

## Result of the changes
* CSS file became shorter and easier to follow
* HTML file contains more meaningful tags rather than DIVs for every section
